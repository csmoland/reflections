When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository allows for collaboration and updating from others and from more than one computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to update your local with things in Git since more than one person might be updating the information.  If you have more than one person updating it, then the updates might not be checked or might be out of alignment with what you are working on locally


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks creates a clone in your account on GitHub.  Clones create a duplicate from GitHub to your local (also can do local to local).  Branches create a new branch for commits if you want to create a new experimental feature, test something out, etc.  Use forking to create a repository from someone elses work so that you can modify it without interupting their work.  Clone is great to take work from GitHub and put it onto your device to work locally on and branching is for testing new versions or trying something new without messing up your own code.  You can always merge the branches later.
