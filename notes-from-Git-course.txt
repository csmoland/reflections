Git Bash

cd asteroids  - example of how to change the directory to the folder that you are trying to use

git diff  237827428973 23428390824  - git the differences between the two commits

git checkout 2347898323  - checkout that version of the commit and test it.  (Puts that at the Head of the commits until you revert back)

git clone - copies entire repository including history onto the computer

git log - shows all of the commits with comments that you made for each commit

git diff - shows the difference between the working repository and the staging area

git diff --staged - shows the difference between the staging area and your most recent committ


git branch - checks for the branchs that you might have created (Master is the default)

git branch nameofbranchhere - creates a new branch called 'nameofbranchhere'

git checkout nameofbranchhere - switches to that branch

git ls-files - shows what files are in the folder

git merge nameofbranch1 nameofbranch2 - merges two branches into a new branch

git log --graph --oneline master  - This puts the commits into an easy to read list  master indicates the master branch

git show commitnumberhere - will show the difference in the commit vs it's parent. Useful when you have merged two branches and don't know the parent.

git branch -d nameofbranch - deletes the branch label.  If you have merged the commits will still be reachable

git reset --hard commitnumberhere - will reset the HEAD of the branch to that commit, effectively deleting the other commits









I'm going to use git to manage version control on my wordpress site that I will set up for the Leadership Development Training.
