Git Bash

cd asteroids  - example of how to change the directory to the folder that you are trying to use

git diff  237827428973 23428390824  - git the differences between the two commits

git checkout 2347898323  - checkout that version of the commit and test it.  (Puts that at the Head of the commits until you revert back)

git clone - copies entire repository including history onto the computer

git log - shows all of the commits with comments that you made for each commit




I'm going to use git to manage version control on my wordpress site that I will set up for the Leadership Development Training.
